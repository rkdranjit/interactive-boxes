## About

This project demonstrates how to create interactive UI components using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page contains three boxes arranged vertically. Clicking any box expands it to reveal dropdown selectors for size and color options, allowing users to customize their selection dynamically.

## Features

- Three distinct boxes positioned top, middle, and bottom.
- Smooth transition effects when expanding or collapsing boxes.
- Each expanded box displays:
  - Two sets of dropdown menus for sizes (S, M, L).
  - Color selection dropdowns with different color options.
- Only one box can be expanded at a time; clicking another box collapses the previously expanded one.
- Responsive and clean design with simple styling.
